        Avila Tile started when our CEO, Cristian Avila, brought his dream to life. He has
        been in the industry for 10 years, in which he has gained much experience and
        learned many tricks of the trade. After working for other people for 3 years, Cristian
        was ready to take on his own projects.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The company is currently expanding and is excited to bring on more team members
        in order to better service your needs. While we are a small company, big projects
        keep us busy.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Our ability to expanding has been by recommendation and word of mouth from our
        clientele, of which we take great pride in not only building your dream project, but
        also in building repertoire with you. We believe the better we understand your
        needs, the happier youâ€™ll be with the finished product.
        From kitchens, floors and bathrooms all the way to commercial properties, Avila
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        We make sure every detail is perfect so that your home and/or business goes
        from a dream to reality.
